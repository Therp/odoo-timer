# Therp Timer
=========================
This uses Odoo Owl library.
NB: We are using manifest v2 because using v3 has some restrictions cause by OWL js using
restricted JS functions e.g:

- eval()
- setTimeout()
- setInterval()
- Function()- normally used by odoo owl js
- setImmediate()
- execScript()
